When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping
all your work local?
to keep it safe server, available to share or collaborate with other teams

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote 
repository?
to make sure only push changes when you are sure the code works
